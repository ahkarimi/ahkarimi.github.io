One of my earliest and most formative projects took place at the **[NLPIC lab](https://nlpic.aut.ac.ir/)** at **Amirkabir University**, where I had the opportunity to develop a **chatbot for the municipality**. Collaborating closely with my supervisors and fellow students, we set out to create a chatbot designed to **collect and categorize reports** from citizens regarding various urban issues. The primary challenge was to ensure that the chatbot could accurately classify these reports into relevant categories, making it easier for municipal authorities to address community concerns effectively.

To demonstrate the chatbot's capabilities, I trained a straightforward **logistic regression classifier**. To my delight, this approach yielded impressive results in text classification, showcasing the potential of machine learning in real-world applications. For the user interface, I utilized a **JavaScript template** that I discovered during my research, and I successfully deployed the demo on **Heroku**, allowing users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.

This project marked my first significant foray into the world of software development, and it was an invaluable learning experience. I gained insights not only into the technical aspects of building a chatbot but also into the importance of teamwork and effective communication in achieving a common goal.

I invite you to explore the code and see the chatbot in action. Your feedback and insights would be greatly appreciated!
