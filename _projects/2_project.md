Despite Persian being one of the **top 10 languages** utilized on the internet, as highlighted by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet), it continues to be classified as a **low-resource language**, particularly in the realm of academic research and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This scarcity is particularly evident when it comes to essential datasets for **intent detection** and **slot filling**â€”two critical components of effective dialogue systems.

Recognizing this significant gap in resources, our team at the **NLPIC lab** embarked on a mission to create a comprehensive dataset and benchmark tailored specifically for Persian. Our journey began with the meticulous translation of the renowned **ATIS dataset** into Persian, allowing us to explore how various models would perform within this newly translated context.

In our pursuit of knowledge, we not only gathered but also rigorously tested **state-of-the-art models** on both the original and Persian versions of the dataset. This process was not merely an academic exercise; it was a commitment to advancing the field of NLP for Persian speakers. We documented our findings in a paper, contributing to the growing body of research in this area.

For those interested in our work, the codes and dataset can be found on **GitHub**: [Persian ATIS](https://github.com/Makbari1997/Persian-Atis). Additionally, our paper detailing the research is available on **arXiv**: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00408).
