For my interview with Amerandish, I was tasked with training a **sentiment analysis** model on a Persian dataset. Drawing from my previous experience with the municipality chatbot, I built a classifier, developed a UI, and deployed it on Heroku (back when it was still free!).

In the spirit of over delivering, I also **fine-tuned a Persian-BERT model** using **PyTorch** on the dataset. This project boosted my confidence, proving that with hard work and passion, anything is achievable. I ultimately joined Amerandish as a junior NLP engineer after this project.
