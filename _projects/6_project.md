One of my first major projects was developing a FAQ chatbot for one of the largest phone operators in Iran. The goal was to answer frequently asked customer questions. At the time, we had pre-trained our own language model (based on BERT), expanded the FAQ dataset, and fine-tuned our model on it. The results were promising, but the chatbot never went live due to political conflicts between the companies.


Throughout this project, I had the chance to engage in valuable discussions with the head of the AI team, where we exchanged ideas and debated solutionsâ€”an enriching experience
