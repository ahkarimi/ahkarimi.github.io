My research is centered around developing innovative techniques that enable machines to understand and analyze `human communication` in `multimodal contexts`. I am particularly focused on creating `machine learning models` and algorithms capable of processing multiple modalities, such as text and visual inputs, with precision.

I have had the privilege of working extensively with `large language models`, contributing both to their `development` and `real-world applications`. While I continue to explore their architecture and potential, my work has also been geared towards implementing these models in practical settings, where they help solve complex challenges and drive meaningful business outcomes.

In addition, I am passionate about exploring areas like `sentiment analysis`, `topic modeling`, and `opinion mining`. My goal is to apply these techniques to `social media data`, enabling deeper insights into public opinion, consumer behavior, and the dynamics of information spread across digital platforms.
